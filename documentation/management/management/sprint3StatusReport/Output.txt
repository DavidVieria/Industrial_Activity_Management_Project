- Suggestions Output:

1. **Enhanced Task Prioritization and Planning**: Improve the prioritization of tasks and planning to ensure that critical tasks are identified and addressed early in the Sprint. This can help in managing time more effectively and reducing last-minute rushes.

2. **Better Hardware Integration and Testing**: Allocate more time and resources for hardware integration and testing, especially for components like Arduino. This can help in identifying and resolving hardware issues earlier in the development process.

3. **Increased Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**: Foster a culture of increased collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. Regular knowledge-sharing sessions can help team members understand different aspects of the project better and reduce dependency on specific individuals.

4. **Improved Documentation and Reporting**: Enhance the quality and detail of documentation and status reports. This can help in better tracking of progress, identifying potential issues early, and ensuring that all team members are on the same page regarding project requirements and progress.
