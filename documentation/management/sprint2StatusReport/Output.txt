He worked diligently on transforming the models to different levels (conceptual, relational, and physical) and addressed challenges related to database structure and buffer logic. Despite some difficulties with a lack of information in earlier stages, David maintained a steady pace and was instrumental in ensuring that the project’s database structure was aligned with the team's needs. His contributions helped keep the project on track, especially in areas requiring technical expertise.

Rafael: Rafael showed strong dedication to his tasks, particularly in working on user stories related to the database and communication with the professor and client for clarification. He handled complex tasks like USEI14 and made steady progress with implementing and testing the ARQCP user stories. Despite encountering challenges with task organization and critical paths, Rafael remained proactive, seeking help when needed and ensuring he stayed aligned with the project’s goals.

Overall Team Performance:
The team demonstrated effective collaboration, despite individual challenges. They communicated well, addressed technical issues efficiently, and maintained a focus on meeting deadlines. However, at times, there were difficulties with aligning individual work with the overall project vision, particularly in the earlier stages. Overall, the team showed growth in handling complex tasks and demonstrated resilience in addressing obstacles.

Team Rating: 4/5
This rating reflects the team's ability to navigate challenges, contribute effectively to the project, and maintain good communication, while still facing some struggles with task alignment and information flow.
